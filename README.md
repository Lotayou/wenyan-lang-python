# wenyan-lang-python
A python compiler and parser for converting wenyan to python scripts.

### Description

### Motivation
Recently, LingDong- publish his amazing project [wenyan-lang](https://github.com/LingDong-/wenyan-lang), which is a javascript based compiler for a unique style of programming with ancient Chinese language. I've been playing around it from the first day this repo was active, and has had great fun and sense of achievement in playing around with it. Also I have suggested some new features for his project, some of which have been adopted as part of the basic syntax (see [nested function call] and my original [feature proposal]())
